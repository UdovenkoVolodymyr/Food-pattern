    "# Search for food patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have identified several search objects <br>\n",
    "1: food entities such as \"yoghurt, sandwich etc.\" <br>\n",
    "2: volume values such as \"200gr\" <br>\n",
    "3: volume entities such as \"cup\", \"glass\", \"tablespoon\" <br>\n",
    "4: quantitative entities such as \"3x\" <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solved the problem of client's various writing: values of volume and quantitative variables\n",
    "Recognizes any recording version, such as '2x', '2 x', '2', '200ml', '350gr', '350 g' etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Volume Values\n",
    "For all existing volume entities, we can specify the volumes that you consider correct. <br>\n",
    "For example: in this case the volume of a glass was set as 250 grams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling of mixed cases\n",
    "Quite often there are cases in which are present both quantitative and volume variables. <br>\n",
    "For example: 2 tablespoons of sugar <br>\n",
    "in this case, proper processing still happens. As a result, we derive a volume of two tablespoons. Because in this case the volume of a tablespoon was set as 18g, our result will be 36 grams of sugar"
